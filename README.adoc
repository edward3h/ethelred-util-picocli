= Picocli Utils

Just my small library of common things I want to do with https://picocli.info/[picocli].

== EnvironmentDefaultValueProvider

Use this default value provider to read option values from environment variables.
Environment variable names start with the application name, followed by the longest name of the relevant option,
with letters uppercase and non-word characters replaced by underscores.

e.g. Application "foo" with option "--my-option" will use environment "FOO_MY_OPTION".
